Things that need to be done before testing release:
(+: may be difficult; -: easy)
+ ability to merge groups 
+ integrate with PayPal
+ show vacancies to not-signed-up users and allow them to sign up for them
- admin should be able to create accounts
- temporary account available for 48h
+ picture upload for description
+ add admin interfaces (as backup for user actions)
- log out should go back to main page
+ notifications (baseline can't be turned off)
- send mail to users (and to designer)
- add mailing list to admin
- disable account (hide: user themselves, purge: by admin)
- group inscriptions: everyone (except for original user) needs to confirm
+ refactor code
- extend visibility across all pages (not visible = unknown)
- turn manual confirmation into Action
+ also make sure casting works properly (some empty roles not displayed?)
- game numbers taken from roles
+ Sort out menus
+ Give feedback when saving things

Stuff that can wait a bit:
- design HTML
- forums
- printing out name tags and role labels

Would be nice to have:
- social login (facebook/OpenID/...)
- achievement system
- interests section (game tags)
- integrating with Google Maps
- user profiles (visible to other users)
- mail templates
